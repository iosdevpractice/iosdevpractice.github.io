title:  "Interview Challenge - Login Form"

Recently, I saw a new subreddit, [/r/iOSChallenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSChallenges/), that plans on featuring weekly iOS development challenges. Looks like a lot of fun. The more practice the better.

The [first
challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSChallenges/comments/2ct0pg/06082014_ios_challenge_1_sample_interview/) was taken from a real world interview question. You build a login form with input validation. Once it passes validation, you show another screen that contains an image and displays a message when the image is tapped. You can see a copy of the interview question [here](http://imgur.com/FSR4qdA).

I decided to use Swift for my solution to the challenge. I also wanted to build the UI from code instead of using Interface Builder. This was a great learning exercise. Fun!

Check out my [solution](https://github.com/iosdevpractice/LoginChallenge). Any advice, questions, comments or
code critique is welcome.

Be sure to keep an eye on
[/r/iOSChallenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSChallenges/). It looks like
this is going to be a great resource.
