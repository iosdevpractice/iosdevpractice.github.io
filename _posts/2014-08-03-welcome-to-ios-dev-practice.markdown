Hello. Welcome to iOS Dev Practice.

When I first started learning to build apps for iOS, I read books, watched videos, completed tutorials, read blog posts and more. I devoured everything I could find related to iOS development, and there is a ton of content available.

I was building a foundation, but it felt like I wasn't learning the things that I really needed to know. After spinning in a loop for a while, I finally decided that to learn how to build apps, I needed to actually build more apps. Amazing, I know.

Hopefully, this will help others come to the same realization. At a certain point you need to stop stalling and just dig in and build some apps. Good luck and get busy.
