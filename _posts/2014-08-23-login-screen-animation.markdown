I just completed challenge #2 from [/r/iOSChallenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSChallenges/). This subreddit is another great place to get practice developing for iOS. Check it out.

The [second
challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSChallenges/comments/2dfmdp/08132014_ios_challenge_2_login_screen_animation/) is another one from an interview. The app consists of having two view controllers that animate back and forth when a button is tapped on each. A gif showing the transition is available [here](http://fat.gfycat.com/PalatablePortlyCrocodileskink.gif).

I went with Swift again for this challenge. I also built the UI from code and used constraints. The solution was more challenging than I initially thought it would be. I did not have any experience with custom view controller transitions or gradients. After playing with it for a while I came up with an implementation that didn't seem overly hacky and got the job done. I did go with a linear gradient instead of the radial gradient in the example image.

Check out my [solution](https://github.com/iosdevpractice/LoginScreenAnimation). As always, any feedback is welcome.
