When learning to develop for iOS, building a strong foundation is extremely important. A good starting base of knowledge is key. Once you understand the basics, adding app specific details is a more manageable task. Luckily, there is a lot of great information available to help build your base.

## Apple Documentation

The amount of quality documentation is staggering.
Become very familiar with the following sections of the outstanding
[iOS Developer Library](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/).

* [Start Developing iOS Apps Today](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/)
~ A guided tour of building your first app. A great place to start.
* [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/)
~ A must read. This is the iOS user interface bible.
* [Cocoa Core Competencies](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/general/conceptual/devpedia-cocoacore/Accessibility.html)
~ Covers many concepts needed while building quality apps.
* [Cocoa Application Competencies for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/Animation.html)
~ Addresses additional core ideas that are specific to iOS.
* [Programming with
Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)
~ Great introduction to Objective-C.
* [The Swift Programming
Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html)
~ Apple's new language for iOS development. (Pre-release)

This is just a small sample of the guides and reference information
available. When learning a new concept, a quick search of the
[library](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/) can do wonders.

## Other Resources

* [iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch
Guide](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming.html)
~ The most recommended iOS book by far. Building all the examples really
helps reinforce what you read. For extra fun, try converting them to Swift.
* [Developing iOS 7 Apps for iPhone and
iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550)
~ This iOS development course from Stanford is the one to watch. Good
stuff.
* [Ray Wenderlich Tutorials](http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorials)
~ Get a feel for things when just starting out by working through a few tutorials.

* [iOS Dev Weekly](http://iosdevweekly.com)
~ A site/mailing list for keeping up to date on what is happening in the
iOS world. Highly recommended.

## Getting Help

* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios)
~ One of the best places to find answers when stuck. Great resource.

* [reddit](http://www.reddit.com)
~ Check out this
[multi](http://www.reddit.com/user/wileywimberly/m/iosdev) or just head to
[/r/iosprogramming](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/).
* IRC ~ #iphonedev on freenode. Ray Wenderlich has a good post
  about [IRC for iOS
  Developers](http://www.raywenderlich.com/77163/irc-for-ios-developers). 

Getting up to speed on iOS development can be a big job. Not only do you
have to learn Objective-C (and now Swift), you also have to familiarize
yourself with the numerous frameworks and learn the core concepts.

Don't get too caught up in trying to learn everything. The best way to
learn is to dive in and start building apps. It will be a struggle
at times, but with the help of the many great resources available, it
will get better with practice. Good luck.
