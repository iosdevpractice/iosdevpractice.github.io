For our first practice exercise, we will build a simple note taking app from the following rough design. For double the fun, build it in both Objective-C and Swift.

Make it so.

## Basic Functionality

* users can enter and view notes
* notes have a modification date
* notes have text contents
* notes are saved between sessions

## Main Screen

* table view in navigation controller
* first line of note is used as the title
* table view cells show note title and modification date
* tapping on a cell pushes note detail screen
* new button in upper right displays detail screen as modal for adding a note
* edit button in upper left used to enter edit mode to delete and reorder notes

## Detail Screen

* show modification date
* show and edit note contents
* show done button in upper right if shown as modal
* show cancel button in upper left if shown as modal
